## Overview

The present repository proposes a benchmarking framework to easily evaluate LLMs' capacity to predict argument relations at the micro-scale level (only guessing the relation between pairs of arguments). The framework is intended to be used with a [preprocessed sample of a dataset from the IBM Debater project](https://huggingface.co/datasets/coding-kelps/liaisons-claim-stance-sample). The obtained results can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/coding-kelps/liaisons-experiments-results).

As mentioned earlier, this work is part of an academic project for the validation of my Master's Degree at Heriot-Watt University, preventing me from accepting any contributions until the final release of my project. Thank you for your understanding.

## Associated Works

This work is part of a collection of works whose ultimate goal is to deliver a framework to automatically analyze social media content (e.g., X, Reddit) to extract their argumentative value and predict their relations, leveraging Large Language Models' (LLMs) abilities:

- [liaisons](https://github.com/coding-kelps/liaisons) (the developed client for social media content analysis)
- [liaisons-preprocess](https://github.com/coding-kelps) (the preprocessing of the original IBM dataset)
- [liaisons-claim-stance-sample](https://huggingface.co/datasets/coding-kelps/liaisons-claim-stance-sample) (the preprocessed sample used with this benchmarking framework)
- [liaisons-experiments-results](https://huggingface.co/datasets/coding-kelps/liaisons-experiments-results) (the obtained results with this benchmarking)
- [mantis-shrimp](https://github.com/coding-kelps/mantis-shrimp) (the configuration-as-code used to set up my workstation for this project)

## About the Development Team

This project is solely conducted by me, [Guilhem Santé](https://github.com/guilhem-sante). I am a postgraduate student pursuing the MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.

## Special Thanks
I would like to credits [Andrew Ireland](http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~air/), my supervisor for this project.
